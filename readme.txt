As per assignment specification:

“If you are using other technologies then package your source code and ensure that the README.TXT indicates that you are not submitting a WAR.”

Though I have submit a WAR, this project must be run as two separate processes to function. I have split the tasks into two projects; the first included as ‘ArchiveToolsProject_COMP4601-A2’ and the other included as ‘RestEndPointsProject_COMP4601-RS’. Inside each archive, find the root project folder.
